# Rule: Backend Integration (C# / .NET)

**Status: mandatory.** The frontend consumes a C# / .NET REST API. The backend
is a separate codebase; this repository contains no server code.

## Contract

- Base URL comes from `environment.portfolioApi` (generated from `.env` by
  `scripts/genenv.js`). Never hardcode the API host in code.
- Current access is **GET-only**. The app is read-only; do not build CRUD UI
  without an explicit decision.
- Live endpoints:
  - `GET v1/overview`
  - `GET v1/experience?includeProjects=true`
  - `GET v1/skill`
  - `GET v1/recommendation`
  - `GET v1/notion/{pageId}`
- Legacy endpoints are not used: `v1/portfolio/count`,
  `v1/portfolio/projects`, `v1/experience/{id}/projects`.
- Do not guess endpoints or response shapes. If something is undocumented, ask.
- Swagger/OpenAPI is currently not exposed at the usual paths. Until it is
  available, `environment.portfolioApi` plus the models in `core/models` are the
  contract.

## Code boundary

- All requests go through `ApiClient` and entity services. Components must not
  use `HttpClient` directly.
- Type request and response models in
  `src/app/features/dashboard/core/models/`.
- If write operations are introduced, add typed request/response models and a
  service method. Never put mutation logic in components.
- Update the corresponding interface **and** `.github/docs/` whenever the
  backend contract changes.
- Surface API failures as explicit error states; do not swallow them or leave
  loading states stuck.

## Configuration and secrets

- Notion page ID and public domain must not be hardcoded in components; move
  them to a config module or environment variable. (Decision pending: see
  `.github/plans/001-tailwind-rewrite.md`.)
- Never commit secrets, tokens, API keys, or `.env` contents. `.env` is
  gitignored; `.env.example` is the template.
- Do not add CORS workarounds or proxy hacks without documenting the constraint.
